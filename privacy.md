<h2><strong>1. INFORMATION WE COLLECT FROM YOU</strong></h2>

    third-party ads in our Apps or with our ads in other publisher's Apps. In general, the information we
    collect about you relates to the type of device you are using, information that helps us identify your device, how

    may be considered personal information under applicable data protection laws, such as:</p>

    advertising partners to show personalized ads to you only if you have pressed ACCEPT in relevant pop-up window and

    like, your interest, behavior, demographics, etc. Our advertising partners may continue to show you ads based on the
    content of the application you are using.</p>
<h3><strong>4.2. In-game advertising </strong>(i.e. when you view ads in Our Apps)</h3>
<p>To enable us to show in-game ads, we may send your advertising ID and IP-address to advertisers (or ad networks) to
    enable them to find appropriate ads to serve to you in our games and on third-party properties. You can control and
    limit our use of your advertising ID in your device settings. We do not control which specific ads are shown in our

        network or ad exchange acts as intermediary between the other game companies and Us. In order for an ad network
        to charge the company buying the ad, clicks from the ad and potentially installs of other developers'
        applications party apps are tracked. Views, clicks, and installs from ads are measured using Advertiser ID;
